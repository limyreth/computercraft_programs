New Features in ComputerCraft 1.5:

. Redesigned Wireless Modems; they can now send and receive on multiple channels, independent of the computer ID. To use these features, interface with modem peripherals directly. The rednet API still functions as before
. Floppy Disks can now be dyed with multiple dyes, just like armour
. The "excavate" program now retains fuel in it's inventory, so can run unattended
. turtle.place() now tries all possible block orientations before failing
. turtle.refuel(0) returns true if a fuel item is selected
. turtle.craft(0) returns true if the inventory is a valid recipe
. The in-game help system now has documentation for all the peripherals and their methods, including the new modem functionality
. A romantic surprise
